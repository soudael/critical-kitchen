# 🧑‍🍳 Critical Kitchen
### Fast-Paced Time and Resource Management Game

## 🏷️ About the Game

**Critical Kitchen** is a chaotic time and resource management game where the pressure never stops rising.

You start your career as a chef in a humble kitchen with a limited menu.
There are no traditional "levels" here, only **milestones**.
To grow your culinary empire, you must hit specific targets to expand your restaurant, upgrade your kitchen equipment, and improve the dining hall.

**Game Loop:**
- **Service:** Seat customers, take orders, cook, and serve before they lose patience.
- **Logistics:** Run to the stockroom to fetch ingredients.
- **Pest Control:** While restocking, you must fend off **rats and moths**. If you take too long, they *will* eat your stock, one by one, reducing your resources.
- **Repeat:** Bring ingredients back to the line and keep cooking.

As the pace becomes critically fast, you'll unlock the ability to hire staff, but can you manage everything while the kitchen burns?
